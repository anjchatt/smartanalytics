This is a rebuild of https://github.com/alitouka/spark_dbscan to support recent Spark versions.
Few minor changes are made.
Ready-made binary is included: spark_dbscan.jar

To build:
1. install SBT http://www.scala-sbt.org/
2. build project:
cd src
sbt assembly
3. copy resulting artifact:
cp target/scala-2.10/spark_dbscan-assembly-0.0.4.jar ../spark_dbscan.jar

To use in spark-shell, append command with "--jars ./spark_dbscan.jar {path to spark_dbscan.jar}", e.g.:
bin/spark-shell --jars ./spark_dbscan.jar
